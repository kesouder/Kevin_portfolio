        <h3> SUMMARY </h3>
        <p> Iâ€™m currently a junior Data Science major at University of California, San Diego. I
            am looking for an enriching internship in a future-focused organization that is using data to bring positive impact to the planet
            through environmentally oriented projects. I am eager to learn from people at the top of their field who are invigorated by their
            mission, and to contribute to that mission in any way I can. </p>
